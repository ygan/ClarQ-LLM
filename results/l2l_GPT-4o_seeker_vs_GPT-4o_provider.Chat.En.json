          "Greetings, Jax. I am on a quest to collect diamonds and I seek your guidance. Given the items in my backpack and the skills I possess, could you advise me on the best approach to find and collect diamonds in this realm? Specifically, which scenes should I visit and how should I utilize my items and skills to maximize my chances of success?",
          "Jax: You need to go to the mine to dig for diamonds. The mine is found through the dangerous forest so you will need to use medicine to protect yourself.",
          "Thank you for the advice, Jax. To clarify, when you mention using medicine to protect myself, are you suggesting I use the Crane's crest red medicines to maintain my health while traveling through the dangerous forest? And should I use the Seven-step powders or the Feigned death drugs to avoid or deter any hostile creatures I might encounter? Also, which mine do you recommend I go to first: the Southern Frontier Mine or the Heavenly Pool Mine?",
          "Jax: The forest is full of man-eating monsters. You can trick the monsters by using the feigned death drug to play dead and protect yourself as the monsters only eat the living.",
          "Understood, Jax. I will use the Feigned death drugs to safely pass through the forest by tricking the monsters into thinking I am not alive. Once I reach the mine, should I use my skill to summon a small shovel or an excavator to dig for diamonds? And is there a specific mine you believe is the best starting point for my diamond collection task?",
          "Jax: Diamonds can only be mined in the Southern Frontier Mine, there are no diamonds in the Northern Mines.",
          "Thank you for the clarification, Jax. I will head to the Southern Frontier Mine to search for diamonds. Given the scale of the mine, would you recommend I use the small shovel or the excavator to dig for the diamonds? And should I be aware of any specific dangers within the Southern Frontier Mine that I might need to prepare for with my remaining items or skills?",
          "Jax: The diamonds are buried deep underground, so you will need to summon an excavator to dig for them.",
          "Understood, Jax. I will use the excavator to dig deep in the Southern Frontier Mine for the diamonds. Before I set out, is there anything else I should know or any other use for my remaining items—such as the Seven-step powders, Crane's crest red medicines, or Bewitching medicines—while I'm in the mine or on my journey?",
          "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details. Just use your excavator skill in the Southern Frontier Mine to dig for diamonds.",

          "I need to steal a treasure map, and I'm looking for the best way to go about it. Given my skills and the places I can visit, what would you suggest?",
          "Jax: Your mission is to infiltrate the luxury villa and steal the treasure map hidden within. The treasure map is locked in a safe in the innermost room on the first floor of the villa.",
          "Understood, Jax. Given that the Luxury Villa is heavily guarded and no outsiders are allowed, could you suggest a strategy for getting past the guards and into the villa? I have a set of swords and skills in unlocking with force, lock picking, and unlocking with magic.",
          "Jax: Wise magicians at the magic school have learnt the power of transformation. Perhaps you could learn their skills and transform your appearance into that of the villa owner to deceive the security guards and make your way into the villa.",
          "That's a clever approach. Which magic school would you recommend I visit to learn this transformation skill? The King's, Queen's, or Angela's Magic School? And once I've learned the skill, how should I proceed with the actual theft of the treasure map from the safe?",
          "Jax: Although Angela's Magic School is no longer accepting students, only Wizard Lillian of Angela's Magic School knows transformation magic, and you can only go to her to learn it.",
          "Got it, Jax. So, I need to visit Angela's Magic School and find Wizard Lillian to learn the transformation magic. Once I've learned the skill and transformed into the villa owner, how should I proceed with getting past the guards and accessing the safe in the innermost room on the first floor? Any tips on dealing with the safe itself?",
          "Jax: It's a mechanical safe so you will need to carefully pick the lock to open the safe. Forcing the safe open will surely make noise and alert the guards, and the safe is impervious to magic.",
          "Thanks for the detailed information, Jax. Just to summarize:\n\n1. Visit Angela's Magic School and find Wizard Lillian to learn the transformation magic.\n2. Use the transformation magic to disguise myself as the villa owner.\n3. Enter the Luxury Villa and make my way to the innermost room on the first floor.\n4. Carefully pick the lock of the mechanical safe to retrieve the treasure map.\n\nIs there anything else I should be aware of or any additional tips you can provide before I proceed?",
          "Jax: You have a solid plan in place. Just focus on using your transformation magic to get past the guards and your lock-picking skills for the safe. The task is straightforward, so no need to worry too much about additional details. Good luck!",
          "Thanks for the guidance, Jax. I'll follow the plan and get that treasure map. Goodbye!"

Given my current location at the Sandy River and the items in my backpack—a jade ring, a pair of gold earrings, and a silver headpiece—along with my skills in purification, restoration, and concentration magic, could you guide me on the best approach to infiltrate the palace without being detected?",
          "Jax: You need to sneak into the princess's palace without drawing attention. Take the unguarded path to reach the gates of Sun City. Once there, you must enter through the gate guarded by a man called Henry. Henry is our undercover agent in Sun City; give him the token so he knows who you are, and he will let you into the city. You must be careful when you are in the Mystic Wasteland and use magic to ensure you do not succumb to madness.",
          "Jax, I understand I need to take the unguarded path and use magic in the Mystic Wasteland to protect myself. However, you mentioned giving Henry a token. I have a jade ring, gold earrings, and a silver headpiece. Which one of these items is the token that I should give to Henry to identify myself as an ally?",
          "Jax: Give the jade ring to Henry and he will know you are one of us. He will help you to disguise yourself in Sun City so you can move freely without arousing suspicion.",
          "Understood, Jax. I'll give the jade ring to Henry as the token. Once I'm disguised, how should I proceed to enter one of the princess's palaces? Should I aim for a specific palace, and is there a particular method or time of day that would be best for sneaking in?",
          "Jax: You need to infiltrate Princess Anna's Palace. You should be able to sneak in through the back door of the palace which is unguarded.",
          "Thank you, Jax. To summarize, I will take the unguarded path to reach Sun City's gates, use my magic to protect myself in the Mystic Wasteland, give the jade ring to Henry at the gate to identify myself, and then he will assist me with a disguise. Once in the city, I will sneak into Princess Anna's Palace through the unguarded back door. Is there anything else I should be aware of or any other advice you can give me before I proceed?",

          "Jax: I saw that the wireless communication equipment washed up on the east coast. It looks like it will still work but it won't power on without batteries.",

So, to summarize:\n\n1. **Collect Food**: I'll gather food from the island.\n2. **Create a Shelter**: I'll set up a tent by the creek on the east coast using fabric and rope.\n3. **Send a Distress Signal**: I'll find the wireless communication equipment and batteries on the east coast, link them up, and send a distress signal.\n\nI'll start by heading to the east coast to find the wireless communication equipment and batteries. Then, I'll set up the tent by the creek on the east coast. Finally, I'll gather food from the island.\n\nThank you for your help, Jax. Goodbye!"

Moreover, be sure to use corrosion-resistant rebar as the proximity to water may be tough on the villa.",

After that, I need to craft a regular knife, soak it in the holy water basin at one of the churches for one day and one night to turn it into a demon-slaying sword, and finally soak the sword and the purple herbs together for one day to obtain the purple demon-slaying sword. Is that correct?",

          "Thank you, Jax. To summarize, I will:\n\n1. Visit the Primeval Forest to gather the red herb.\n2. Visit the Tropical Rainforest to gather the blue herb.\n3. Crush and mix the red and blue herbs to create the purple herbs.\n4. Craft a regular knife (e.g., a folding knife, butcher's knife, or military knife) using iron ore.\n5. Soak the crafted knife in the holy water basin at Saint Andy's Church for one day and one night to turn it into a demon-slaying sword.\n6. Soak the demon-slaying sword and the purple herbs together for one day to obtain the purple demon-slaying sword.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know, or does this cover everything?",

          "Jax: what can help you?",
          "Hello, Jax. I need to capture the bat beast. I have chicken meat, beetles, bananas, and a bow and arrows in my backpack. I can set a net trap, set a pitfall trap, attack with my bow and arrows, and place items. \n\nCan you tell me how to complete this task based on these items and skills? Also, which scene should I visit to find the bat beast?",
          "Jax: To capture the bat beast, you need to set up a trap in the forest in advance and place its favorite fruit to lure it into the trap. To draw it in, you also need to go to the coast where it frequently appears and use a bow and arrow to drive it away from the coast. Once it leaves the coast, it will most likely seek shelter in the nearest forest, so you should place the trap there. The coast is too open to set up any traps.",
          "Thank you, Jax. Just to clarify:\n\n1. I need to set up a trap in a forest.\n2. I should place the bat beast's favorite fruit in the trap to lure it.\n3. I need to go to the coast where the bat beast frequently appears and use my bow and arrows to drive it away from the coast.\n4. The bat beast will then seek shelter in the nearest forest, where it will encounter the trap.\n\nCould you please tell me which forest is the nearest to the coast where the bat beast frequently appears? Also, what is the bat beast's favorite fruit?",
          "Jax: The beast is really just a giant fruit bat. It loves bananas the most so you can use those to lure it to your trap. Just place bananas from the coastline all the way to your trap to lead it in.",
          "Got it, Jax. So, to summarize:\n\n1. I need to set up a trap in a forest.\n2. I should place bananas in the trap to lure the bat beast.\n3. I need to go to the coast where the bat beast frequently appears and use my bow and arrows to drive it away from the coast.\n4. I should place a trail of bananas from the coastline to the trap to lead the bat beast into the trap.\n\nCould you please tell me which forest is the nearest to the coast where the bat beast frequently appears?",
          "Jax: You should set your trap in the Mysterious Forest that hugs the coastline. The other forests are too far away.",
          "Thank you, Jax. Here's my plan:\n\n1. I will set up a net trap in the Mysterious Forest, as it is the nearest forest to the coast.\n2. I will place bananas in the trap to lure the bat beast.\n3. I will go to the coast where the bat beast frequently appears and use my bow and arrows to drive it away from the coast.\n4. I will place a trail of bananas from the coastline to the trap in the Mysterious Forest to lead the bat beast into the trap.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know or prepare for before I proceed with this plan?",
          "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details. Just set up your net trap in the Mysterious Forest, place the bananas, and drive the bat beast from the coast. The game map will navigate you.",
          "Thank you, Jax. I understand now. I'll set up the net trap in the Mysterious Forest, place the bananas, and drive the bat beast from the coast. The game map will guide me through the rest.\n\nGoodbye, Jax!"

Here are the items I have:\n\n- High Voltage Electromagnetic Sprite Ball\n- High Temperature Electromagnetic Sprite Ball\n- Iron Mesh Ball\n- Copper Mesh Ball\n- Money\n\nAnd these are my skills/actions:\n- Use an electro-magnetic trap to catch creatures\n- Use a fine net to catch creatures\n- Use a coarse net to catch creatures\n- Mix food with medicine\n\nAdditionally, I can visit the following scenes:\n- Farmland\n- Suburban Hills\n- Florence Department Store\n- Pipi Food Store\n- Yige Food Store\n- Qiqi Pharmacy\n- Tili Pharmacy\n\nWhat should I do to capture the crop-razing sprite?",

Once the sprite is asleep, use the proper ball to catch it.\n\nCould you tell me which ball would be the most effective for capturing the sprite once it's asleep?",

          "Hi Jax, I need to take a video of a customer on a galloping horse against the light on a beach. I have several cameras, fill light setups, and a stabilizer. I can also ride a horse. Could you guide me on how to complete this task? Specifically, which beach should I go to, and what equipment and techniques should I use?",
          "Jax: The shooting location is ready. You just need to bring the appropriate camera, lenses, fill light, and the horse to the site and hand them over to the staff. They will set everything up for you, and you can start shooting directly when you arrive.",
          "Thanks, Jax. Could you please specify which beach I should go to and which camera, lens, and fill light setup would be best for this task? Also, where can I get the horse from?",
          "Jax: The shooting location is on the west coast because it's the only place that will be backlit in the evening. The staff has already been there to prepare in advance.",
          "Got it, Jax. So, I'll head to the West Coast for the shoot. Could you also tell me which camera and lens would be best for capturing a video of a galloping horse against the light, and which fill light setup I should bring? Additionally, where can I get the horse from?",
          "Jax: You should use fill lighting with a warm tone.",

          "Jax: You should use the Caesar brand camera and lens, as they produce the best results for portraits and action shots.",
          "Great, Jax. Just to confirm, I'll head to the West Coast with the Caesar camera and lens, the fill light setup with a warm tone, and borrow a horse from a local farm. Is there anything else I need to know or prepare before I go?",
          "Jax: Your plan looks solid! Heading to the West Coast with the Caesar camera and lens, the warm tone fill light setup, and borrowing a horse from a local farm sounds like a great approach. Do you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of the preparation?",
          "No, that covers everything I needed. Thanks for your help, Jax. Goodbye!"

          "Jax: what can help you?",
          "Hello, Jax. I need to explore the castle and I have a few items and skills that might help. Could you guide me on how to complete this task? Specifically, how do I unlock the Castle Gate and navigate through the different areas to reach the Treasure Room?",
          "Jax: To complete the quest you need to reach the room in the castle where the treasure is stored and use the treasure chest key to open the locked treasure chest in that room. To enter the castle, you will need to play the Concerto of the Earth in front of the gate for the castle doors to open. Additionally, the halls are full of monsters, and you must enter at a specific time to avoid encountering them. Once inside the castle, go straight through the foyer and halls and you'll find the entrance to the labyrinth. The labyrinths in the castle are quite large, but luckily, I understand their patterns. Whenever you come to a fork in the maze, always take the rightmost path so that you can find the exit directly and without detours.",
          "Thank you, Jax. Just to clarify:\n\n1. To unlock the Castle Gate, I need to play the Concerto of the Earth. Which movement should I play to open the gate?\n2. You mentioned entering at a specific time to avoid monsters. What time should I enter the castle?\n3. Once inside, I should always take the rightmost path in the mazes to find the exit. Is that correct?\n\nCould you confirm these details for me?",
          "Jax: You need to play the third movement of the Concerto of the Earth to open the castle doors.",
          "Got it, Jax. So, to summarize:\n\n1. I need to play the Autumn Sound (Concerto for the Earth, 3rd movement) on the mystic flute to unlock the Castle Gate.\n2. I should enter the castle at a specific time to avoid monsters. Could you please tell me what time that is?\n3. Once inside, I should always take the rightmost path in the mazes to find the exit.\n\nCould you confirm the specific time I should enter the castle to avoid the monsters?",
          "Jax: You will only avoid encountering monsters during the hour between 12 PM and 1 PM.",
          "Thank you, Jax. Here's my plan based on your guidance:\n\n1. I will play the Autumn Sound (Concerto for the Earth, 3rd movement) on the mystic flute to unlock the Castle Gate.\n2. I will enter the castle between 12 PM and 1 PM to avoid encountering monsters.\n3. Once inside, I will navigate through the Entrance Hall, Great Hall, and then the mazes by always taking the rightmost path to find the exit.\n4. Finally, I will use the appropriate treasure chest key to open the locked treasure chest in the Treasure Room.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know or any additional advice you can offer before I proceed?",
          "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details. Just follow the steps you've outlined: play the Autumn Sound, enter between 12 PM and 1 PM, and take the rightmost path in the mazes. You'll be fine!",
          "Thank you, Jax. I appreciate your help. I'll follow the steps as outlined:\n\n1.

To clarify, here are the steps I think I need to take:\n\n1. **Install Micro Power Generation Equipment:**\n   - Install the small-scale wind power generator.\n   - Install the small-scale solar power generator.\n\n2. **Set Up Communication Networks:**\n   - Set up a power line carrier communication network to link the residential houses and electric vehicle charging points.\n   - Set up a wireless communication network for additional flexibility and redundancy.\n\n3. **Install Control Systems:**\n   - Install the Solar System intelligent network control system, Galactic intelligent network control system, or Leo intelligent network control system to manage the smart grid.\n\n4. **Integrate and Balance the Grid:**\n   - Ensure the control system can balance the grid load by diverting power from electric vehicle batteries to residential use during peak hours and recharging the vehicles during low usage hours.\n\nCould you confirm if these steps are correct and if there are any additional details or specific instructions I need to follow?",
          "Jax: Your plan looks well thought out and comprehensive! Do you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any of the steps?",
          "Thanks, Jax! I just have a few specific questions to ensure I execute the plan correctly:\n\n1. **Micro Power Generation Equipment:**\n   - Is there a preferred location within the community for installing the small-scale wind and solar power generators?\n\n2. **Control Systems:**\n   - Among the Solar System intelligent network control system, Galactic intelligent network control system, and Leo intelligent network control system, which one is best suited for this task, or are there specific criteria I should consider when choosing one?\n\n3. **Communication Networks:**\n   - Are there any specific areas or nodes within the community where I should focus on setting up the power line carrier communication network and the wireless communication network to ensure optimal performance?\n\n4. **Integration and Balancing:**\n   - Are there any specific settings or configurations I need to apply to the control system to ensure it properly balances the grid load by diverting power from electric vehicle batteries to residential use and vice versa?\n\nYour guidance on these points would be greatly appreciated!",
          "Jax: You should install a solar system intelligent network control system for the community, as other control systems are for use with smart high-voltage grids. The solar system smart network control system will automatically handle the scheduling of electric vehicle energy.",
          "Got it, Jax. Thanks for the clarification. Here’s my updated plan:\n\n1. **Install Micro Power Generation Equipment:**\n   - Install the small-scale wind power generator in an open area within the community, possibly near the parking lot or a central location.\n   - Install the small-scale solar power generator on rooftops of residential houses or other structures with good sun exposure.\n\n2. **Set Up Communication Networks:**\n   - Set up a power line carrier communication network to link the residential houses and electric vehicle charging points.\n   - Set up a wireless communication network to provide additional flexibility and redundancy.\n\n3. **Install Control System:**\n   - Install the Solar System intelligent network control system to manage the smart grid.\n\n4. **Integrate and Balance the Grid:**\n   - Ensure the Solar System intelligent network control system is properly configured to automatically handle the scheduling of electric vehicle energy, balancing the grid load by diverting power from electric vehicle batteries to residential use during peak hours and recharging the vehicles during low usage hours.\n\nI believe I have all the information I need now.

Specifically, which location should I go to, and are there any additional steps or requirements I need to be aware of?",
          "Jax: Your task is to excavate artifacts in the ancient cemetery. The first step of the excavation work is to set up a work area, using store-bought tents for this purpose. Then, you can start excavating, but you must use correct excavation tools to ensure the integrity of the artifacts. Once you have finished excavating, you need to take photos of the excavated artifacts and send the photos to Professor George's email.",
          "Thank you, Jax. That helps a lot. Just to clarify, here are the steps I need to follow:\n\n1. **Set up a work area**: I need to buy a tent from either Lily's Department Store or Sam's Department Store and set it up at the excavation site.\n2. **Excavate the artifacts**: Use the correct excavation tools (small shovel, hoe, large shovel) to carefully excavate the artifacts.\n3. **Document the findings**: Take photos of the excavated artifacts.\n4. **Send the documentation**: Send the photos to Professor George's email.\n\nI have a few follow-up questions:\n1. Which specific tomb (West, East, South, or North Mountain Tombs) is the ancient cemetery located in?\n2. Do I need a work permit to enter the tomb where the ancient cemetery is located?\n3. Could you provide me with Professor George's email address?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can proceed with the task.",

          "Thank you, Jax. I have noted Professor George's email address. However, I still need to know:\n\n1. Which specific tomb (West, East, South, or North Mountain Tombs) is the ancient cemetery located in?\n2. Do I need a work permit to enter the tomb where the ancient cemetery is located?\n\nCould you please provide this information so I can proceed with the task?",
          "Jax: You need to go to the Archaeological Laboratory to find Professor Henry to obtain an archaeological work permit so that you can enter the cemetery.",
          "Thank you, Jax. Here is my plan based on your guidance:\n\n1. **Visit the Archaeological Laboratory**: Go to either the White Archaeological Laboratory or the Royal Archaeological Laboratory to find Professor Henry and obtain an archaeological work permit.\n2. **Purchase a tent**: Visit Lily's Department Store or Sam's Department Store to buy a tent.\n3. **Set up the work area**: Go to the specific tomb where the ancient cemetery is located (I still need to confirm which one) and set up the tent.\n4. **Excavate the artifacts**: Use the correct excavation tools (small shovel, hoe, large shovel) to carefully excavate the artifacts.\n5. **Document the findings**: Take photos of the excavated artifacts.\n6. **Send the documentation**: Send the photos to Professor George's email at nlp@xxx.yyy.\n\nBefore I proceed, could you please confirm which specific tomb (West, East, South, or North Mountain Tombs) the ancient cemetery is located in?",
          "Jax: Your mission is to go to the East Mountain Tombs, as the other tomb complexes have already been excavated and analyzed by other archaeologists.",
          "Thank you, Jax. I now have all the information I need. Here is my final plan:\n\n1. **Visit the Archaeological Laboratory**: Go to either the White Archaeological Laboratory or the Royal Archaeological Laboratory to find Professor Henry and obtain an archaeological work permit.\n2. **Purchase a tent**: Visit Lily's Department Store or Sam's Department Store to buy a tent.\n3. **Set up the work area**: Go to the East Mountain Tombs and set up the tent.\n4. **Excavate the artifacts**: Use the correct excavation tools (small shovel, hoe, large shovel) to carefully excavate the artifacts.\n5. **Document the findings**: Take photos of the excavated artifacts.\n6. **Send the documentation**: Send the photos to Professor George's email at nlp@xxx.yyy.\n\nThank you for your help, Jax.

          "Hello, Jax! I need to complete the task of planting watermelons. I have a hoe, yellow flesh watermelon seeds, seedless watermelon seeds, small watermelon seeds, and some money. I can plant watermelons, spray fertilizer, spray herbicide, and construct irrigation channels. Can you guide me on how to proceed with planting the watermelons?",
          "Jax: Your plantation has vast grounds for growing food. In your possession are various watermelon seeds and a hoe. You will want to plant the best-selling watermelon variety from last year. However, it's currently winter, so you'll need to build a greenhouse to grow watermelons in and dig an irrigation canal to draw water from the river to your watermelon plantation. You'll also need to use fertilizer and herbicide to grow good watermelons.",
          "Thanks for the information, Jax. I have a few questions to clarify:\n\n1. Which watermelon variety was the best-selling last year?\n2. Where can I get the materials or help to build a greenhouse?\n3. Which river should I draw water from for the irrigation canal?\n4. Where can I get the fertilizer and herbicide needed for growing the watermelons?\n\nYour guidance on these points will help me complete the task.",
          "Jax: You will have to contact a Dwarven Construction Team to build the greenhouse, as they are masters of glass making.",
          "Got it, Jax. I'll contact the Dwarven Construction Team for the greenhouse. \n\nCould you also tell me:\n1. Which watermelon variety was the best-selling last year?\n2. Which river should I draw water from for the irrigation canal?\n3. Where can I get the fertilizer and herbicide needed for growing the watermelons?\n\nYour guidance on these points will help me complete the task.",
          "Jax: The best-selling watermelon variety last year was the seedless watermelon.",
          "Thanks, Jax. I'll focus on planting the seedless watermelon seeds.\n\nCould you also tell me:\n1. Which river should I draw water from for the irrigation canal?\n2.

          "Jax: King Bell has entrusted you with the task of forming an alliance with King Alpha. However, a direct approach to form an alliance won't work, as King Alpha is troubled and hesitant. If you can help King Alpha rescue his daughter, the princess, then forming an alliance will become feasible. His daughter has been captured by the black dragon, and you need to defeat it to save the princess. To defeat the black dragon, you will need to use ice magic to arrest it and then subsequently attack. After rescuing the princess, return her to King Alpha safe and sound and hand him the letter of alliance to form the alliance.",

For the live-action video, you need an actor, and you can go to the school to find George, who is a young actor. Then you can go to the circus to borrow a horse from Henry. You can complete the task this way.",
          "Thanks for the detailed instructions, Jax. Just to make sure I have everything clear:\n\n1. **Buy a green screen**: I should go to either the East District Department Store or Jojo Department Store to purchase a green screen.\n2. **Set up the film set**: Head to the Film and Television Shooting Base and set up the green screen as the background.\n3. **Find an actor**: Visit East District Middle School or East District Elementary School to find George, the young actor.\n4. **Borrow a horse**: Go to the Wandering Circus or Park Circus to borrow a horse from Henry.\n5. **Shoot the video**: Use my camera to film George riding the horse in front of the green screen.\n6. **Edit the video**: Use either the Extreme Point AI or Lightning AI video production tool to replace the green screen with a grassland background.\n\nIs that correct?",
          "Jax: Your plan looks solid and well-organized! Do you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any of the steps?",
          "Thanks, Jax! Just a couple of quick clarifications:\n\n1. **Green Screen Purchase**: Is there a specific store between the East District Department Store and Jojo Department Store that you recommend for buying the green screen?\n2. **Finding George**: Is George more likely to be at the East District Middle School or the East District Elementary School?\n3. **Borrowing the Horse**: Should I go to the Wandering Circus or the Park Circus to find Henry and borrow the horse?\n\nOnce I have these details, I think I'll be all set to complete the task.",
          "Jax: Only Jojo Department Store sells green screens.",
          "Got it, Jax. I'll head to Jojo Department Store for the green screen. \n\nIs George more likely to be at the East District Middle School or the East District Elementary School? And should I go to the Wandering Circus or the Park Circus to find Henry and borrow the horse?",
          "Jax: George goes to school in the Eastern District Middle School, you can find him there.",
          "Thanks, Jax. I'll find George at the East District Middle School.\n\nLastly, should I go to the Wandering Circus or the Park Circus to find Henry and borrow the horse?",
          "Jax: Henry works at the Wandering Circus, you can find him there.",
          "Perfect, Jax. Here's my final plan:\n\n1. **Buy a green screen**: Go to Jojo Department Store to purchase the green screen.\n2. **Set up the film set**: Head to the Film and Television Shooting Base and set up the green screen as the background.\n3. **Find an actor**: Visit East District Middle School to find George, the young actor.\n4. **Borrow a horse**: Go to the Wandering Circus to borrow a horse from Henry.\n5. **Shoot the video**: Use my camera to film George riding the horse in front of the green screen.\n6. **Edit the video**: Use either the Extreme Point AI or Lightning AI video production tool to replace the green screen with a grassland background.\n\nThanks for all your help, Jax.

You can first go to the magic school and learn fire magic from Teacher Green. It should be noted that using fire magic requires fire crystals. Once you successfully defeat the Wind Elf, its wind magic will automatically transfer to you.\nMr. Green works at the Royal Magic School, you can find him there.\nFire crystals can be purchased from merchant Henry at the tavern by paying 200 gold coins.\nYou can first sell the crystal or electric crystal to Henry, and each crystal can be sold for 100 gold coins, so you have enough money to purchase fire crystal to complete the task.\nHenry is at the Flower Field Tavern.\nWind elves only appear in Illusionary Realm of Space.",
